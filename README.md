# RecipePal
Food recipe collobration application with a group of 5. My role was Devops Manager and I was responsible for managing deployment pipelines, maintaining version control through GitHub, and configuring Google OAuth 2.0. I also deployed the application on Heroku, troubleshooted technical issues, and assisted team members in setting up their development environments. Developed the profile and user login systems, which included features such as Google authentication, secure password storage, user profile creation, and the ability to update personal information. I also implemented backend functionality to manage user sessions and integrated API requests to streamline authentication processes.
